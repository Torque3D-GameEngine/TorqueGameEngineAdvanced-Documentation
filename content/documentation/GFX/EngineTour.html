                <a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink1"></a>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This document will explain the source code folders and files that
                  make up GFX. If you have not done so already, make sure you read the
                  following docs first: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Getting Started Directory Overview (PC Version) / (Mac Version) </li>
                  <li>GFX Overview </li>
                  <li>Engine Architecture </li>
                </ul>
                <a name="GFX_Core" id="GFX_Core"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink2"></a>GFX Core</h2>
                <p>You can find the core GFX files in <b>engine/source/gfx</b>. Some of
                  the source files in this system are meant to be sub-classed based on
                  platform. An example can be found in gfxDevice.h. If you open this
                  file, you will see several blocks of commented code that make learning
                  GFX a lot easier. Back to the point, there are currently 5 main
                  gfxDevice classes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>GFXDevice </li>
                  <li>GFXD3D8Device </li>
                  <li>GFXD3D9Device </li>
                  <li>gfxGLDevice </li>
                  <li>gfxNullDevice </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, each platform gets its own GFXDevice. The same goes
                  for other platform dependent files: gfxShader, gfxCubemap,
                  gfxVertexBuffer, and so on. Some of the other source files are
                  stand-alone. For instance, gfxStructs.h contains classes/structs and
                  functions used by all platforms. This usually involves generic
                  information, such as GFXLightInfo containing light type, position, etc. </p>
                <a name="DirectX_.28D3D.2C_D3D8.2C_D3D9.29" id="DirectX_.28D3D.2C_D3D8.2C_D3D9.29"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink3"></a>DirectX (D3D, D3D8, D3D9)</h2>
                <p>Prior to TGEA 1.8, DirectX was the only API supported by the engine.
                  This meant that development and publishing could only happen on
                  Windows. Now that TGEA 1.8 supports OpenGL for cross-platform
                  compatibility, it is more important than ever to keep the GFX layers
                  separate. </p>
                <p>The D3D folder contains only two files: screenshotD3D.h and
                  screenshotD3D.cpp. Just as the name implies, these two files are used
                  in capturing screens while running a game, <i>currently D3D9 only</i>.  If you haven't guessed already, GFX supports both Direct3D8(D3D8) and Direct3D9 (D3D9). </p>
                <p>You'll see the major platform specific classes represented here,
                  such as the GFXdevice, TextureManager, VertexBuffer, etc. The
                  functionality remains the same, but the application and execution are
                  specific to the API. </p>
                <a name="OpenGL_.28gl_and_ggl.29" id="OpenGL_.28gl_and_ggl.29"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink4"></a>OpenGL (gl and ggl)</h2>
                <p>Much like the D3D sections, the gl folder and its files contain
                  rendering functionality specifically meant to run on a Mac. Once again,
                  the major systems are integrated into the OpenGL layer (StateBlock,
                  gfxDevice, PrimitiveBuffer, etc). Within the gl directory is another
                  folder: ggl. </p>
                <p>The source code in this section make up the GarageGames OpenGL
                  Library. In the code itself, you will find the various OpenGL
                  configurations, bindings, and extension definitions. </p>
                <a name="Null" id="Null"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink5"></a>Null</h2>
                <p>The Null folder contains gfxNullDevice.h and gfxNullDevice.cpp. This
                  device layer is used primarily for dedicated servers, which typically
                  do not require any rendering. Dedicated servers usually just process
                  simulation events and relays that information to the clients. There is
                  no real reason to waste processing power and memory rendering objects
                  that no one will see. </p>
                <a name="Sim" id="Sim"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink6"></a>Sim</h2>
                <p>The 3 systems found in this folder are: CubeMapData, gfxStateBlockData, and debugDraw. </p>
                <p><b>debugDraw</b> does exactly what it sounds like. Once you
                  enable debugDraw, you can pass it data (Point3Fs and ColorF) which will
                  then render points, cubes, and other polygons. For instance, if you
                  pass in the points that make up a Player's bounding box, you will see a
                  box surrounding that player when running the game. </p>
                <p><b>CubemapData</b> is a class exposed to TorqueScript, making
                  the class a ConsoleObject. A Cubemap is a texture that represents a
                  rendering of the surrounding environment. The easiest example to
                  explain would be a Sky cubemap rendered onto a body of water. The
                  cubemap would consist of various sky images taken from different
                  angles. </p>
                <p><b>GFXStateBlockData</b> is extremely important. StateBlocks
                  are introduced in TGEA 1.8. Since GFXStateBlocks are meant to be
                  created in script, a ConsoleObject that can hold StateBlock description
                  was needed. GFXStateBlockData is that ConsoleObject. We will cover this
                  in greater detail later. </p>
                <a name="Test" id="Test"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink7"></a>Test</h2>
                <p><i>You can ignore this folder, as it was used during internal testing</i>. </p>
                <a name="RenderInstance" id="RenderInstance"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink8"></a>RenderInstance</h2>
                <p>Another section of engine code that is considered an important part
                  of GFX can be found under renderInstance
                  (engine/source/renderInstance). The files found in this directory make
                  up the various render managers. We will cover these in the next GFX
                  document. For now, just remember these classes are responsible for
                  controlling the rendering flow of your game. </p>
                <a name="Conclusion" id="Conclusion"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink9"></a>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This is another high level walk through of a TGEA system. Even
                  though we covered some major files and concepts, you should take the
                  time to read through the code comments left by GarageGames developers.
                  Some of this will make more since as you read through the remaining GFX
                  documents. </p>
                <p>Continue on and read the next section: GFX Render Management (<i>TODO: Make Link</i>). </p></td>
