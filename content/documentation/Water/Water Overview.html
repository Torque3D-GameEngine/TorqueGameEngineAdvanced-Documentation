<p>This section of the docs will provide a high level tour through some of the major systems that interact with each other, in order to make up the water system for Torque Game Engine Advanced.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title style1" style="clear: both"><a name = "HeaderLink1"></a>Setting the water transform</h2>

            Unlike many of the other water parameters, the position, rotation, scale, and
            gridSize can all be changed and updated while in the editor without the need
            for reloading the mission to see the results.  Moving and rotating a WaterBlock
            is done in the same way as any other object.  The scale and gridSize control 
            the size.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title style1" style="clear: both"><a name = "HeaderLink2"></a>The Grid</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <p> The water is square in shape because it is set up as a brute-force grid mesh.
    It will draw all of the vertices in the grid regardless of what your view
    distance may be set to. </p>
  <p> One of the most important performance parameters for the WaterBlock is gridSize.
    The gridSize controls how much spacing there is between vertices in the grid - 
    and therefore how many vertices there are in the grid.
    It should be set as high as possible as suits the needs of the environment.  The
    reason for this is that when the water draws, it will always draw the entire grid.
    So if you have a 2 kilometer by 2 kilometer size WaterBlock, it will process
    all of the vertices in the grid, even if you have a viewing distance of a few
    hundred meters.  If your gridSize is set large enough in this case, it's not a 
    big deal.  A size of 100 for instance, would process 400 vertices for a 2000x2000 size grid.
    If your gridSize was 10, however, it would process 40000 vertices which is much
    slower and wouldn't look a whole lot better. </p>
  <p> There are two reasons for having lower gridSize values.  The first is fogging.
    Fog is calculated per-vertex, so if the fog distance less than or near
    to the gridSize, there will likely be artifacts in the fog because the grid is
    not fine enough.  If the fog distance is very near, and the WaterBlock is large,
    it might be best to change the shader such that the fog calculations are done
    per-pixel instead of per-vertex.  Then the WaterBlock could be expanded into one
    large quad. </p>
  <p> The second reason for small gridSizes would be smaller WaterBlocks.  A WaterBlock
    can only be as small as one grid element and the size of that element is the
    gridSize parameter.  Ie. if you want a 10x10 size WaterBlock, you must have at
    most a gridSize of 10. </p>

  </div>
  <p> There are wave settings for the waves that are used in the ps 2.0 water shader.
    The wave parameters do not affect the 1.0 water movement.
    
    The water shader uses the wave parameters to sample the water bumpmap and combine
    it in different ways to get the final movement effect. It averages the first two 
    waves and adds the third at 1/3 the strength of the first two.  The purpose of
    the third wave is to break up repetitive patterns that the first two can form.  It
    is best, therefore, to use a larger texture scale for the third wave.
    
    The parameters for the waves are: </p>

        <div><strong><em>          waveDir</em></strong><br>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <p> WaterBlocks are capable of providing full dynamic reflections for pixel shader
    2.0+ hardware.  They will reflect everything in the scene.  To reflect only
    certain objects, the "objTypeFlag" variable can be changed in the 
    WaterBlock::updateReflection() function.  The reflections are updated at roughly
    60htz.  This can also be changed in the updateReflections() function. </p>
  <p> Full reflections are expensive to render.  To kick the reflections down to 
    static cubemap reflections, set the "fullReflect" parameter to false; </p>
  <p> The pixel shader 1.1 water reflects only a cubemap.  The bump surface itself is
    generated by blending two normalmaps in a pixel shader to a render target.  The
    render target is then used for a bump-environment map operation to get the
    "shiny" bump / cubemap interaction. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <p> Fog is calculated on a per-vertex basis in the ps 2.0 rendering path.  The gridSize
    can affect how the fog looks if the fog is fairly close in.  The <a href="ch06s02.html#Grid">Grid</a> section
    covers this in more detail.  The fog uses the fog texture generated by the scenegraph
    for consistency with the rest of the scene. </p>
  <p> The ps 1.1 path is rendered as a second pass over the bumpEnvMap pass.  It uses a
    stencil operation to avoid z-fighting on the surface over large areas.  A special
    fog mesh is generated for this path.  It is a radial mesh (a set of
    linked concentric rings) that expands as it gets further out to reduce vertices.
    Rendering of the fog mesh can be turned off by setting the "renderFogMesh" parameter
    to false. </p>

  <p> There are several "Surface Material" slots that identify which Materials
    are to be used for varius passes.  The MaterialType enum in WaterBlock.h
    dictates which slots are used for which passes.  At the time of this writing,
    the first slot is used for the "base" material.  The underwater material is
    in the second slot, followed by the fog material (for the 1.1 fog pass).  The
    fourth material is used for blending the normal map used on the 1.1 base surface.
    The final material is used when dynamic textures are turned off. </p>
