<h2 class="style1">Torque Game Engine Advanced (TGEA) Documentation Overview</h2>
<h3 class="style1"><a class="anchor" name="Intro_TandT">Welcome</a></h3>

<p class="style1">Torque is a large piece of software. Chances are that most of the applications you have worked on up to this point have only been a fraction of the size of Torque. This reference manual has been created in order to give you - be you a beginning developer or an experienced C++ programmer or somewhere in between - a step up on manipulating and extending Torque.</p>

<p class="style1">This document is divided into multiple section, each of which contains information related to specific subject. This means of organization allows you to jump to different chapters containing information that is pertinent to what you wish to work on. Below, you will find a high level description of the various sections and a recommendation of where to start.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Getting%20Started/Getting%20Started.html">Getting Started</a>: There is no right or wrong way to develop your game, but we have provided a &quot;Right Way&quot; to start using Torque. The Getting Started section contains a comprehensive introduction to Torque, which includes the proper step by step instructions for setting up your development environment. Within this section, you will not only be shown what programs you need to download to begin working Torque, but how to install and set up each critical application. If you are an absolute newcomer to Torque Technology, it is highly recommended you start here to learn about the DirectX SDK, installing a C++ Compiler, compiling Torque's source code, and touring the SDKs folder hierarchy.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Scripting%20Reference/Introduction/TorqueScript.html">Scripting Reference</a>: Torque is essentially comprised of two main components: source and script. Torque Script (TS) is a proprietary language similar to C++, developed by Garage Games. This section of the document provides an intro to TS, a guide on proper syntax and variables, and a compendium of Console Functions and Objects exposed from the source code.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Engine%20Overview/index.html">Engine Overview</a>: The largest section of this document is dedicated to the Engine and source code overview. Experienced C++ developers who want to jump right into the source code should thoroughly read this section, as it covers the engine architecture, core systems, networking model, rendering systems, and more.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Mission%20Editor/Overview.html">Mission Editor</a>: One of the two major What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) editors is the Mission Editor. Within this section, you will get a brief and high-level overview of this powerful level editor. Read through this portion of the document to learn about the interface, tools, and Terrain Editor.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/GUI%20Editor/GUI%20Introduction.html">GUI Editor</a>: The other WYSIWYG editor is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Editor tool. Within this section you will read about the interface layout, editor functionality, how to modify an existing GUI, and how to create a new dialog. </p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Materials%20and%20Shaders/Materials.html">Materials and Shaders</a>: Unique to TGEA, compared to other Torque engines, is the Material and Shader system. If you have no idea what a shader is, or if you want to understand how TGEA's material system makes full use of shaders, definitely start reading here. Introductions, terminology, and examples are waiting within.</p>
<p class="style1"><a href="documentation/Using%20Art%20Assets/Introduction%20to%20Asset%20Pipeline/Content%20Generation%20Process.html">Using Art Assets</a>: Whether you are an artist or a programmer, you should have a firm understanding of Torque's asset pipeline. This sections covers the major file formats used by Torque to render 3D geometry, as well as an introduction as to what tools, exporters, and procedures are at your disposal.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Tutorials</strong>: <em>Coming Soon</em></p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><b>Once you have gotten your feet wet with Torque, please feel free to offer us feedback on your experiences with <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=hDFp7S9JzcSpH1U2cEGQxw_3d_3d" target="_blank">this survey!</a></b></p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Again, if you have just downloaded the engine you are highly encouraged to proceed to the Getting Started section of this document. A strong foundation and stable starting point will save you much debugging effort later in your development. Just click on the giant text found below.</p>
