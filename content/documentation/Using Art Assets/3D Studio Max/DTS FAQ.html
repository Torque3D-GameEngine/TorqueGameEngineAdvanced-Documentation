  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Can I group objects?</strong><br>
  A group can be deceiving as it may appear as though the object is properly
  named, but in reality, the objects within it are not (they retain the names
  they had before they were grouped). Think of a group as a visual
  simplification that you can open, modify, and then close and return to your
  scene. Due to the way that groups actually work, they can cause problems when
  you export. Therefore it is best that you do not group any objects when you
  try to export the scene.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Can I use any of Max's sub-division
  modifiers?</strong><br>
  It is recommended that you don't for two reasons. The first being that it is
  counter productive since you <span class=GramE>are</span> aiming for low poly
  models. The second being that the exporter doesn't really like the
  sub-divisional modifiers (such as <span class=SpellE>Tesselate</span>, <span
  class=SpellE>MeshSmooth</span>, and HSDS) when it tries to export your model.
  If you must use a sub-divisional modifier to create your object, it is
  recommended that you collapse the object to a mesh or polygon before applying
  your skinning or texturing.</p>
  <p><em>(I've found that the exporter chokes on polygon objects that have skin
  modifiers, like characters. It gives me an &quot;assertion failed&quot; when
  I try to export. It'll only export properly for me when I first collapse the
  model to a mesh object. This is in 3ds max version 5. -Spencer <span
  class=SpellE>Boomhower</span>)</em></p>
  <p><strong>I have heard that it sometimes helps to collapse my modifier stack
  when exporting. Is this true?</strong><br>
  Yes, this can sometimes help your model when you are trying to export as it
  collapses the entire object (at its current state) into a single, solid mesh.
  This can be beneficial when you have an object that is generating errors when
  exporting, and is sometimes a valid solution to get around that problem. Just
  remember to keep backups of your un-collapsed meshes though, in case you need
  to go back a few steps later. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Some artists recommend working in an Editable
  Mesh object throughout because everything useful in the model can be obtained
  from an editable mesh. Just remember to make incremental saves so that you
  can go back to previous versions if you need to change something </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>I have seen a lot of on-line
  references that show examples of using <span class=SpellE>spline</span>
  shapes to generate your object. Can I do this with Torque?</strong><br>
  You certainly can, but you will likely want to either collapse the modifier
  stack or add an Editable Mesh modifier onto the object after you have built
  your shape from an Extrude, Loft, or Surface modifier.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>I have imported a file that I created
  in another program into Max, but when I look at my object, faces are missing
  or not connected. Why?</strong><br>
  Some file formats (such as 3DS) do not contain information on vertex <span
  class=SpellE>normals</span>. So, if you brought a model in from another
  program, Max must generate the <span class=SpellE>normals</span> and
  sometimes will get them wrong. To solve this problem, add a <st1:place w:st="on">Normal</st1:place>
  modifier to each object and choose flip <span class=SpellE>normals</span>. If
  only some of the <span class=SpellE>normals</span> are incorrect you will
  need to manually go in and fix them yourself using the Edit Mesh or Edit Poly
  modifier.</p>
  <p><strong>What is this “box trick” that I always see reference to when
  people talk about resetting the transforms?</strong><br>
  The box trick is a way of properly resetting the transform information for an
  object that you have scaled. And it involves the following: </p>
  <p>Make a box, put it at the origin of the bounding box (use the align tool)
  and then collapse the box so that it becomes an editable mesh. Go into the
  modifier panel and click on the attach button, <span class=GramE>then</span>
  click on your character mesh to attach it to the box that you just created.
  The character should now be a part of your newly created box. Choose
  &gt;Select by Element&gt; select the box shape and delete it. Your character
  mesh has a brand new transform, now rename your character mesh so that it conforms
  to the export parameters. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>It is also sometimes necessary to perform the
  box trick on bounding boxes as well as meshes.</p>
  <p><strong>Do my skeletons (Bones or Biped) need to look like people?</strong><br>
  No, you can make your skeleton look and operate any way that you feel. To quote
  Joe <span class=SpellE>Maruschak</span> if you can build it, it can be used.</p>

  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Can I use transparency on a PNG file
  instead of the alpha channel?</strong><br>
  Max does not know how to read the transparency value of a PNG file. It does,
  however, know how to read the alpha channel from a PNG.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>What types of materials can I use?</strong><br>
  Standard and Multi/Sub-object are the only material types that should be used
  on the models you are exporting to Torque. Any of the other material types
  such as <span class=SpellE>Raytrace</span> Blend, Composite, Matte/Shade,
  Hardware <span class=SpellE>Shader</span>, Shellac, Top/Bottom, and any new
  material type that is added from a Max <span class=SpellE>plugin</span> can
  in theory be used, but the exporter will likely ignore the information
  contained in it.</p>
  <p><strong>How can I make my material reflective</strong><br>
  If the environment mapping is turned on in the engine (this does not work in
  the show tool), you need to check the reflection channel in the material
  editor (you do not need to put a texture in the slot). If you adjust the
  spinner that is next to the reflection channel, you can control the amount of
  reflectivity the object has. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>For additional information please see
  Environment Mapping in the DTS Exporter Tutorial by Joe <span class=SpellE>Marushchak</span>.
  </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How can I make my material translucent?</strong><br>
  To make an object translucent, the texture on the object must have an alpha
  channel. The amount of translucency is controlled by the alpha channel. Put
  the texture in the diffuse mapping slot and check the opacity checkbox in the
  material editor. You do not need to put a texture in the opacity <span
  class=GramE>slot,</span> it will get the opacity information from the alpha
  channel of the diffuse texture.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How do I setup bump maps on my
  object?</strong><br>
  Normal maps and grayscale bump maps can be assigned to your textures in the
  materials file.</p>
  <p><strong>What is an IFL and why is it used?</strong><br>
  An IFL is an Image File List or an Image File Library, which is essentially a
  text document with a list of filenames. When you play an IFL the program
  reads this list and during each frame it displays the filename as the texture
  (proceeding in order usually from the top of the list to the bottom). Using
  an IFL file is a viable alternative to using animated <span class=SpellE>GIFs</span>
  or AVI files to have a looping texture. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Note that the engine is currently set to <span
  class=GramE>propend</span> a &quot;skins&quot; directory to IFL resource
  names. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Can I use multiple UVW map channels
  to texture my model?</strong><br>
  No, only one UVW channel is supported by the exporter.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Can I use material IDs to help me
  texture my model?</strong><br>
  Yes.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>I have a transparency material
  applied. Why when I view the object do things seem inside out?</strong><br>
  In order for translucent shapes to draw correctly, they must be forced to
  sort in the correct order. <span class=SpellE>Prepend</span> the name of the
  object with SORT<span class=GramE>::</span> to tell the exporter that this
  object may have trouble sorting. The exporter will take extra steps to ensure
  it sorts correctly in the engine. You will have to ignore this problem if it
  is happening within Max.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Do all of my player character
  textures need to be named <span class=SpellE>player.png</span>?</strong><br>
  No, you can call them whatever you like (unless you like to overwrite
  existing files).</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How do I make my entire object
  transparent, or animate its transparency?</strong><br>
  Add a visibility channel to your object in the track view and set the value
  of the visibility from within there. For information on how to assign a
  visibility track to your object and how to use <span class=SpellE>keyframes</span>
  to control the visibility, consult your 3DS Max documentation.</p>
  <p><strong>Can I use <span class=SpellE>mapchannels</span> greater than 1 to
  help setup my texture mapping?</strong><br>
  No! <span class=SpellE>Mapchannels</span> that are greater than 1 will not be
  exported to the DTS format. They will be ignored and your texture mapping
  information on those <span class=SpellE>mapchannels</span> will be ignored
  upon export. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Note: This is fairly common for RT3D engines
  and is not a problem specific with the Torque game engine. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How do I turn on the Environmental
  Reflections in Torque?</strong><br>
  Provided that you have setup your material correctly you will need to add the
  following lines of code: In your <span class=SpellE>player.cs</span> file you
  need to set <span class=SpellE>emap</span> to true; and in \client\<span
  class=SpellE>prefs.cs</span> you need to change the value of $<span
  class=SpellE>pref:<span class=GramE>:environmentMaps</span></span> from 0 to
  1. Please note that environmental reflections will only work with player or
  vehicle objects.</p>
  <p><strong>Are there any issues that I should be aware of if I use a
  multi/Sub-object material on my model?</strong><br>
  In fact there is. Using Multi/Sub-Object materials on your models can affect
  the performance of the engine. When you have multiple textures on your model,
  the engine must draw (and keep in memory) an instance of the model for each
  texture that is applied to it. So if you have 2 textures applied to a node
  and that node is 500 polygons, the engine will actually have to draw 1000
  polygons and keep that data in memory. </p>
  <p>As such, although you can do it, you should be aware of the consequences
  involved in texturing this way and know that it is highly recommended to use
  only 1 texture per model. </p>

  <p><strong>When I move my bones in the viewport the object does not move

  Go into the skin modifier of the object in question. Select a bone and look
  at the envelope that the bone is casting. A bone will only affect vertices
  that its envelopes are overlapping (these <span class=SpellE>verticies</span>
  will be shown as red in the viewport display). Adjust the envelope by moving
  it to ensure that it has influence over the correct vertices in your object.

  Character Studio on my character?</strong><br>
  Yes you can, but you will need to use the Skin modifier (instead of the
  Physique modifier) to apply it to your model.</p>
  <p><strong>What is <span class=SpellE>ComSkin</span> and where can I find it?</strong><br>
  <span class=SpellE>ComSkin</span> is an updated Skin modifier for Max version
  3 that was presented at a GDC conference a few years ago. It has several
  advanced features that are not found in the R3 version of Skin. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>It is included in the R4 and subsequent
  versions of Skin. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Should I use Bones or Biped?</strong><br>
  It doesn't matter if you use bones or biped. All that matters is that the
  bones, biped parts, or whatever node is in the shape has the same NAME as the
  one in the animations.</p>
  <p><strong>My object is too big! How can I scale it down without wrecking the
  Biped, Bones or skin setup?</strong><br>
  Biped -- If the character already has Skin (or Physique) on it you should be
  able to just pick the root node of Biped and scale it. All the other bones
  (of the Biped) are children of the root Biped node, so they should follow
  along and scale appropriately. It is recommended that you turn off the Skin
  (or Physique) and scale the model by itself and then reset the scale. After
  that is done, reset the Skin (or Physique) and turn it back on. If there are
  errors with how the bones move or how the Skin modifier is setup, you may
  need to reapply your Skin modifier. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Bones -- Scaling your bones and then linking
  them (or when they are linked) up to objects in your scene is something that
  should be avoided. To change a bones length go into the bones properties and
  turn off Freeze Length. Turn off the Skin modifier. Then move the child bone
  to change its parent's length (and/or change the size and shape of the bone
  in R4). After you have made your changes to the bones, select all of the
  bones, go back into their properties, press reset length, then refreeze the
  length of the bones. Finally turn the Skin modifier back on and test. If
  there are any problems with how the bones are affecting your object you may
  need to reapply your Skin modifier. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>After UVW <span class=GramE>unwrapping</span>
  my model, why are the texture coordinates messed up in the game?</strong><br>
  This is likely due to a very large texture being used on your object. Your
  texture should be no larger than 512x512 pixels in size for it to be used
  properly in the Torque Engine.</p>
  <p><strong>Can I use more than one texture map on a single mesh?</strong><br>
  Yes you can. Use a Multi/Sub-Object material and assign the correct face IDs
  to your mesh for a specific material to appear on specific faces.</p>

  <p>There are numerous ways to do this with bones, the easiest though would be
  to go into your track view and copy the rotation track from one bone and then

  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The solution: make sure there is only one .<span

  You are likely using your CFG file to never export a bone that is currently

  are created by the exporter when the <span class=SpellE>Multires</span>
  modifier is used. Information on how to use the unmessdts.exe file can be
  found in the DTS Exporter documentation.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Does the shape exporter work with Max
  5?</strong><br>
  Yes, but not officially. Discrete changed the <span class=SpellE>MultiRes</span>
  <span class=SpellE>plugin</span> in Max5. In order to get the exporter to
  work you need to backup your copy of the <span class=SpellE>MultiRes</span>
  DLM in Max5 and copy in the <span class=SpellE>MultiRes</span> DLM from Max4.</p>
  <p><strong>How do I scale my model and its bones?</strong><br>
  Unfortunately there is no easy answer to this question, the problem lies in
  the fact that you are scaling the bones that a modifier on your mesh is
  referencing to perform the deformations based on the bone transforms. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>To re-adjust your scale, you will need to do
  the following: 1. Save your weighting for your deformation modifier to a
  file. 2. Remove your deformation modifier from your model. 3. Scale the model
  and re-adjust the size of your biped to the correct size. Note if you are
  using bones, they typically do not scale well. If you have any problems you
  will need to rebuild them. 4. Reset the transform information on your
  geometry that you scaled (not biped or bones). 5. Add your deformation
  modifier back onto your geometry. Add all of the biped or bones data that you
  need with it into the modifier. 6. Load your weight table that you saved in
  the first step back into your modifier. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How can I export animations that I
  have done with a modifier in Max?</strong><br>
  Any animation done with any modifier found in Max can be exported to a DTS
  file. To export this animation information you must flag the morph animation
  option in the DTS Sequence object that you add to your scene, otherwise this
  information will not be exported.</p>
  <p><strong>Why does my rotation animation look fine in max but stutter in the
  engine?</strong><br>
  If you fail to match your start and end positions, TGE will reset the objects
  position to what it sees at the start of the sequence. This causes the jump
  or stutter effect that you see because the position that it is moving to
  between two frames is completely different. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>In order to solve this problem set the end
  key frame of your object(s) animation to go 360 degrees (so that it loops
  correctly). If you liked the timing you had set, increase the end time of the
  animation, move your keys, and adjust them as previously mentioned. Don’t
  forget to move your sequence start/end keys too. </p>
  <p><strong>Why is my weapon placed incorrectly on the mount node?</strong><br>
  You probably do not have an accompanying <span class=SpellE>mountpoint</span>
  node in your weapon model DTS file. Without this node your weapon will be
  placed based on the location of the bounds shape. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Either <span class=GramE>that,</span> or your
  weapon script might be telling the weapon to be offset. </p>
  <p><strong>Why after scaling my scene do all of my nodes seem to be placed in
  the wrong location?</strong><br>
  When the exporter looks at your scene and reads the helper, it finds that the
  <span class=GramE>helpers</span> base position is in one location, but the
  scale is visually telling you that it is in another. Since scales are applied
  onto your 3D data (they do not actually change it) the exporter reads the
  original location and dumps that into the DTS shape. </p>
  <p>If this has happened to you, you will have to replace all of these helpers
  or find some way to undo your scale. A better solution, if it's available,
  would be to import the nodes from a previous version of the file (before you
  scaled) and have them replace your existing ones. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>As a general rule you should never scale your
  dummy nodes. </p>
  <p><strong>Why is the polygon count of my object higher in Torque than in
  Max?</strong><br>
  There are a few items that typically increase polygon count past what was
  displayed when you built your model in Max. </p>
  <p>The first is that your skeletal systems polygons that make up its shapes
  are included in the count that the Torque Game Engine gives you. </p>
  <p>The second is that when the exporter encounters a material with
  double-sided <span class=GramE>flagged,</span> it actually exports two sets
  of polygons (the normal polygons that you see and then another set of flipped
  polygons) for the model/node that the material is applied upon. This is not
  something that should concern you or affect the performance of your TGE
  application. That is unless you made a large object use a double sided
  material. In that case, thousands of unnecessary polygons are being rendered.
  </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The third is that TGE will include all of
  your collision geometry in this total as well. </p>
  <p><strong>My character exports successfully so why does it look distorted in
  the in the <span class=SpellE>ShowTool</span>?</strong><br>
  You are probably forcing the Bip01 node to be exported in either your DTS or
  your DSQ which is causing odd transform data to be read by Torque and applied
  to your DTS shape. Change your CFG file that is used to export this model or
  sequence so that node Bip01 is &quot;always ignored&quot;.</p>

  You likely have your bounding box set to inherit z motion from the object
  that it is linked to. You will need to deactivate this in the Hierarchy tab.
  This will keep bounds from following your character as he jumps up or down.
  You will also want to increase the bounds size to allow your character to
  jump without going outside of the bounding box.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Why are all of my objects facing the
  wrong direction when I bring them into my game?</strong><br>

  and export again.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>The collision detection on my object
  is not working. Why?</strong><br>
  All of your collision objects must be convex. If there is a concave part of

  the necessary collision markers.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Why can't I see my object’s actions
  happening when I play a sequence in the game?</strong><br>
  Make sure that your sequence is long enough to cover the length of time that
  an animation requires. Also make sure that you have named your sequence
  correctly so that it matches the correct sequence action within the Torque
  engine.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Error: &quot;Illegal transform animation

  than your object (at any time during any of the animations) and export again.</p>
  <p><strong>When I load my character into the game it looks like I am viewing
  from his foot level. Why?</strong><br>
  You either forgot to add an Eye or Cam dummy, the Eye and <st1:place w:st="on">Cam</st1:place>
  dummy where omitted by the exporter (they were not on the always include
  list), or you forgot to move the dummies to the correct location on the

  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The Eye and Mount nodes are getting culled
  out on export. If they are not in the DTS shape, they default to mounting at

  Always Export list. </p>
  <p><strong>Why does my character rotate into the ground when I try to make it
  flip?</strong><br>
  If you are using the bounds object to do the rotation you will cause the
  character to rotate at the soles of his feet (instead of the hips or another
  location). This is because the pivot location of the bounds object in Max is
  the location of the ground in the Torque engine. When you try to rotate your
  character using the bounds object, you are actually rotating your character
  at a point near his feet causing the character to go into the ground. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>To get around this, either rotate an object
  that is at, or near, the characters hip (this could be a mesh, a dummy, or a
  bone), or do the animation inside of Max instead of programming it into the
  engine.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How can I make it easier to have
  sounds added to the actions of my character?</strong><br>
  Although your programmer would need to do the actual work implementation of
  this, you can help out in the processes of triggering a sound from an
  animation by putting a key and a key value in the trigger track of the
  sequence helper.</p>
  <p><strong>Why when I load my model into the engine is everything I attach
  incorrectly oriented?</strong><br>
  This is likely a problem with how nodes such as mount0 are oriented. You need
  to remember that there are several coordinate systems within your 3D
  application and the default setting is typically view. This will display the
  model transform data to you based on the viewport that you are looking
  through. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Switch the coordinate system to local and
  then look at your nodes. All of your nodes should have their Z axis facing
  up, and their Y axis pointing towards the direction that you wish them to
  emit from. If they are not, you need to go into the Motion Command Panel,
  click on the affect pivot only button and then rotate the pivot point until
  it is oriented correctly. </p>
  <p><strong>Why won’t objects sort correctly?</strong><br>
  The SORT function in the DTS exporter is made for little objects. You can
  force a SORT situation using your scene tree. The way models are assembled in
  the scene and how the hierarchy is setup is Identical to how the object is
  assembled in the engine. Any body who has ever used a scene tree knows about
  parent -&gt; child relationships. DTS uses this as well. </p>
  <p>For instance, if you are building a tree (foliage model) using a multi <span
  class=SpellE>subobject</span> material (1 trunk texture, 1 or more foliage
  texture), you would set you material with the solid texture first and the transparent
  textures second. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>This will force things to be built correctly
  in the Z-buffer. The object will be assembled in game the same way as the <span
  class=SpellE>heirachy</span> dictates, automatically sorting your transparent
  textured shapes. Any Model can be assembled this way no matter how
  complicated but it does require breaking your model up into smaller pieces
  and setting up the hierarchy correctly. This works for any <span
  class=SpellE>modelling</span> application that uses a <span class=SpellE>scenetree</span>.
  </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Why won't some animation sequences
  apply to my DTS shape?</strong><br>
  For a sequence to be applied to a DTS shape, all of the skeletal nodes and
  all of the TGE nodes (such as eye, cam, mount, light, ski, etc.) must match
  between the two files. If they do not, the engine will not allow your
  sequence to be applied.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Why does my shape look invisible?</strong><br>
  Check that you are viewing your model at the best LOD. Use the show LOD
  feature in Torque Show Tools in order to see if the smallest LOD shows your
  model. This is a problem that happens when your LOD is setup badly in Max. If
  you think you can see him and know the model is present because the shadow is
  cast, or Torque has no problems loading it and manipulating it in-game - You
  should check <span class=GramE>your</span> <span class=SpellE>LODs</span>.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>
    <strong>Is it possible to export from <span class=SpellE>Gmax</span> to
  Torque?</strong><br>
  No, there is no <span class=SpellE>Gmax</span> Exporter for Torque, nor is it
  likely that there ever will be. </p>
  <p>Sure the program is free, but writing an export <span class=SpellE>plugin</span>
  for <span class=SpellE>GMax</span> is NOT free. The EULA gives you the right
  to use <span class=SpellE>gmax</span> with authorized game packs, that's it.
  There is no such pack for Torque (<span class=SpellE>eg</span>. Tempest for
  Q3, etc). </p>
  <p>There are problems with making a <span class=SpellE>GMax</span> game pack
  for Torque because it could potentially be used for so many different games,
  losing Discreet a lot of money on potential Max licenses. </p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>There is a way to pass this by exporting from
  <span class=SpellE>GMax</span> to .MD3, and loading the .MD3 in <span
  class=SpellE>milkshape</span>, where you can export it to torque. <a
  href="http://www.quake3bits.com/files/md3/ExportMD3_gmax_beta1.zip"
  title="http://www.quake3bits.com/files/md3/ExportMD3 gmax beta1.zip">Here</a>
  is a link to <span class=GramE>a</span> .MD3 exporter for <span class=SpellE>GMax</span>.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>How do I load Max 3 <span
  class=SpellE>MultiRes</span> models into Max 4?</strong><br>
  When Discreet added <span class=SpellE>MultiRes</span> as a Max R4 default <span
  class=SpellE>plugin</span> they changed the <span class=SpellE>plugin</span>
  ID#. Ignore this error, delete the missing modifier and add the <span
  class=SpellE>Multires</span> modifier to the object again.</p>
  <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><strong>Error: &quot;An error has occurred
  and the application will close&quot;</strong><br>
  If you encounter this problem frequently your best solution is to make a post
  on the GG forums (or the Discreet Max Forums) and inform us of every detail
  about your system. Things such as your version of Max, hardware that is in
  your system, driver version for your hardware, BIOS version, software that is
  running at this time, memory specifications, operating system, will allow
  other people to try to help troubleshoot what your problem is.</p>
  <p><strong>How can I get the <span class=SpellE>Multires</span> LOD <span
  class=SpellE>macroscript</span> (<span class=SpellE>adjustlod.mcr</span>) to
  work properly?</strong><br>
  One method that will allow you to get the script working is to do the
  following: </p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
   <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Open up your <span
       class=SpellE>maxscript</span> listener window </li>
   <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Open the <span
       class=SpellE>adjustlod.mcr</span> file </li>
   <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Remove these two lines
       from the top of the script:<br>
       <span class=SpellE>macroScript</span> <span class=SpellE>adjustLODs</span>
       <span class=SpellE>category:&quot;Torque_Tools</span>&quot; <span
       class=SpellE>tooltip:&quot;Adjust</span> <span class=SpellE>LODs</span>&quot;<br>
       (</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Remove this line from
       the bottom of the script:<br>
       )</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Select all of the
       remaining lines in the script (<span class=SpellE>ctrl+a</span>) and
       perform a drag and drop onto the tab panel located at the top of your
       screen. I recommend that you create your own tab panel for your own
       custom scripts so that you don't mess things up. This will create a
       small button on the tab panel. If you click on the button the floater
       window with the <span class=SpellE>AdjustLOD</span> script will generate
       and load.</li>
  </ol>
