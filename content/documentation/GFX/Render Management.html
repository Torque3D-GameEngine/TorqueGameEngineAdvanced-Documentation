                <a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink1"></a>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Most of the rendering system concepts from pre-TGEA 1.8 have been
                  left intact. One system that has changed It shouldn't be a hard
                  transition to use the changes that have been made. The purpose of GFX2
                  is to allow for more flexibility at runtime within the current
                  structure. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Most of the rendering code has been moved from familiar
                  classes/structs, such as SceneManager and RenderInst. The member
                  variables and functionality have been split across multiple render
                  managers, which you should find quite easy to pick up on. </p>
                <a name="RenderInst" id="RenderInst"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink2"></a>RenderInst</h2>
                <p><b>RenderInst</b> used to be a class that contained all the
                  information needed to render an object. This included sorting
                  information, geometry, textures, vertex and primitive buffers, and so
                  on. When TGEA 1.7 was released, RenderInst became a struct, but still
                  contained nearly all the same information. </p>
                <p><br />
                  TGEA 1.8 strips RenderInst down to a very simple structure. It now acts
                  as a base structure for more task-specific render managers. The current
                  version of RenderInst only contains information on sorting,
                  translucency, and rendering type overrides. </p>
                <a name="ObjectRenderInst" id="ObjectRenderInst"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink3"></a>ObjectRenderInst</h2>
                <p><b>ObjectRenderInst</b> is a new structure derived from RenderInst,
                  declared directly below the RenderInst structure. It contains variables
                  and functionality used in rendering an object (RIT_OBJECT) instance
                  type. The ObjectRenderInst basically just contains a pointer to to the
                  object to call back into for its rendering function. It does not
                  contain any information about meshes, materials, transforms, etc. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Along with the SceneState of the object, ObjectRenderInst contains a very important element: the <b><a href="Render%20Delegate.html" title="TorqueGameEngineAdvanced/1 8 Beta/RenderDelegate">Render Delegate</a></b>. </p>
                <a name="MeshRenderInst" id="MeshRenderInst"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink4"></a>MeshRenderInst</h2>
                <p>Derived from RenderInst, a <b>MeshRenderInst</b> object contains the
                  critical information needed for rendering. It is declared directly
                  below ObjectRenderInst. Within this structure, an object's
                  geometry(mesh), lighting information, textures, transforms, and
                  miscellaneous rendering states are kept as internal members. </p>
                <p>Some of the most basic GFX classes are used in RenderMeshInt: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>GFXVertexBufferHandleBase and GFXPrimitiveBufferHandle handle the vertex buffer and primitive buffer (respectively) </li>
                  <li>World and object to world transforms are handled by MatrixF pointers </li>
                  <li>LightInfo pointers retain information for primary and secondary lighting </li>
                  <li>GFXTextureObject pointers also aid in lighting, as well as texturing the object. </li>
                </ul>
                <a name="RenderBinManager" id="RenderBinManager"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink5"></a>RenderBinManager</h2>
                <p><b>RenderBinManager</b> is the first manager we are going to cover.
                  This class manages and renders out a list of MainSortElem structures
                  (mElementList). A MainSortElem is a simple struct that wraps a
                  RenderInst object with a key. In essence, RenderBinManager manages and
                  signals a main list of RenderInst objects. </p>
                <p><br />
                  RenderBinManager contains the variables and functions
                  necessary for adding, processing, sorting, and clearing RenderInst
                  objects. To get a closer look at RenderBinManager, open <i>engine/source/renderInstance/renderBinManager.h</i> and <i>renderBinManager.cpp</i>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Most of the important management functionality is defined in the class,
                  but you should notice a very important chunk of functionality missing: <b>rendering code</b>. RenderBinManager does have a rendering function: </p>
                <pre>virtual void render(SceneState *){};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  But as you can see, we are not going to be directly using a
                  RenderBinManager for rendering. It's important to know how the class's
                  base functionality works, but we will get to the actual rendering code
                  when we look at RenderBinManager's children. </p>
                <p><br />
                  This class lays the ground work, but the tangible rendering
                  sub-managers derive from RenderBinManager: renderMeshMgr,
                  renderObjectMgr, renderTranslucentMgr, and so on. These are detailed
                  further down in the <a href="#Sub-Managers" title="TorqueGameEngineAdvanced/1 8 Beta/GFXRenderManagement">Sub-Managers section</a>. </p>
                <a name="RenderPassManager" id="RenderPassManager"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink6"></a>RenderPassManager</h2>
                <p>The RenderPassManager could be considered the "top manager" when it
                  comes to GFX2's rendering system. We can actually refer to this class's
                  instantiation: <b>gRenderInstManager</b>. We can do so, since there is only one instantiation of RenderPassManager: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>At the bottom of engine/source/renderInstance/renderPassManager.h:</b> </p>
                <pre>extern RenderPassManager* gRenderInstManager;
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  As you can see, gRenderInstManager is a global variable. This means we
                  can use our one RenderPassManager anywhere we include the class's
                  header. This necessary considering the responsibilities of this
                  manager: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Declaring and organizing the various RIT : "R"ender "I"nstance "T"ypes </li>
                  <li>Allocating a render instance for MeshRenderInst, ObjectRenderInst, and so on. </li>
                  <li>Adding, sorting, and rendering a list of RenderInst's per bin </li>
                  <li>Memory allocation and deallocation for the RenderBinManagers </li>
                  <li>Adding, sorting, and managing the various RenderBinManagers. The importance of this task is best shown in code: </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br />
                  <b>In engine/source/renderInstance/renderPassManager.cpp:</b> </p>
                <pre>void RenderPassManager::_initBins()
{
   _uninitBins();

   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Sky, 0.1f, 0.1f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Begin, 0.2f, 0.2f));
   addManager(new RenderMeshMgr(RIT_Interior, 0.3f, 0.3f));
   addManager(new RenderMeshDynamicLightingMgr(RIT_InteriorDynamicLighting, 0.4f, 0.4f));
   addManager(new RenderMeshMgr(RIT_Mesh, 0.5f, 0.5f));
   addManager(new RenderMeshDynamicLightingMgr(RIT_MeshDynamicLighting, 0.55f, 0.55f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Object, 0.6f, 0.6f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Shadow, 0.7f, 0.7f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Decal, 0.8f, 0.8f));
   addManager(new RenderRefractMgr(0.9f, 0.9f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Water, 1.0f, 1.0f));
   addManager(new RenderObjectMgr(RIT_Foliage, 1.1f, 1.1f));
   addManager(new RenderTranslucentMgr(1.2f, 0.01f));
   addManager(new RenderGlowMgr(1.3f, 1.3f));
}
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Even if you are not yet a master of GFX2, the premise behind
                  this chunk of code is simple. RenderPassManager has a function called
                  _initBins. This is called as soon as our SceneGraph's rendering is
                  initialized. </p>
                <p><br />
                  An internal list of RenderBinManagers is stored within
                  RenderPassManager. We have managers for Sky, Interiors, Lighting, Mesh,
                  Objects, Shadows, and so on. Those managers get stored in the internal
                  bin list. Calling gRenderInstManager "the manager of managers" seems
                  appropriate. </p>
                <p><br />
                  If you read the class from top to bottom, the layout of the code and
                  accompanying comments will provide you with a few more details as how
                  the RenderPassManager performs is duties and what other classes are
                  involved. </p>
                <a name="Sub-Managers" id="Sub-Managers"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink7"></a>Sub-Managers</h2>
                <p>As mentioned previously, the actual rendering managers are children
                  of RenderBinManager. We are calling them sub-managers, since the
                  RenderPassManager manages and maintains them. Each of these rendering
                  sub-managers contains rendering code unique to its purpose, though
                  multiple instantiations do occur to handle our various renderable
                  Torque objects. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Let's go down a simplified list of these classes and their main purpose: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>RenderObjectMgr</b> - This class is used for rendering more
                    than any of the other sub-managers. This manager is responsible for
                    rendering common objects that do not have a standard mesh.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Sky </li>
                      <li>Shadows </li>
                      <li>Decals </li>
                      <li>terrain chunks </li>
                      <li>fxSunLight </li>
                      <li>waterblocks </li>
                      <li>foliage </li>
                      <li>shapebase. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>RenderMeshMgr</b> - This class is used for rendering mesh
                    based objects such as interiors and TSMesh. Additionally, RenderMeshMgr
                    has children. One such class, RenderMeshDynamicLightingMgr, is
                    described next. </li>
                  <li><b>RenderMeshDynamicLightingMgr</b> - As the name describes,
                    this class manages the rendering dynamic lighting on a mesh. This is
                    primarily used with the SG lighting kit additions to TGEA which provide
                    dynamic lighting on meshes and interiors. </li>
                  <li><b>RenderRefractMgr</b> - Stock TGEA uses only one
                    RenderRefractMgr. The name of the manager describes it well. This
                    manager takes in RenderInst elements and checks to see if they have a
                    refraction custom material. If this check succeeds, the element is
                    maintained by the manager and makes use of the refraction rendering
                    code. </li>
                  <li><b>RenderTranslucentMgr</b> - Stock TGEA uses only one
                    RenderTranslucentMgr. This manager is a bit more complex than the
                    previous ones described. A RenderInst element must meet a strict set of
                    requirements to be managed by this class. If you look at
                    RenderTranslucentMgr::addElement(...), you can see there are 3 main if
                    statements checking for translucent properties and appropriate render
                    instance type. Additionally, RenderTranslucentMgr must setup/modify the
                    scene graph data and stateblocks before it can render its elements. The
                    actual render function is quite clean, and you can gain more insight
                    about the class by reading through it. </li>
                  <li><b>RenderGlowMgr</b> - Just like the previous two managers,
                    there is only one instance of RenderGlowMgr in stock TGEA 1.8. The name
                    is pretty self-descriptive. This manager is responsible for accepting
                    RenderInst elements that require rendering with a properly set up glow
                    buffer. </li>
                </ul>
                <a name="Conclusion" id="Conclusion"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink8"></a>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this doc was to provide you with a basic
                  understanding of the rendering management system used by TGEA's GFX2
                  (introduced in version 1.8). There is still much to be explained in the
                  way of rendering flow, extending the system, and specific examples. </p>
                <p><br />
                  We've covered the basic renderable object instances, base class render
                  managers, specialized rendering manager classes, and touched on some
                  new subjects such as the RenderDelegate. If you would like a more
                  concrete example of GFX2's changes and how render management works,
                  read through the RenderDelegate doc and Sky Comparison Guide. (TODO:
                  links here). </p></td>
