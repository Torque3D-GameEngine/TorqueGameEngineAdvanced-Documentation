<font size='+2'><b>What is the difference between Concave and Convex?</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>Why is Concave vs Convex important to Torque?</b><br>
<br>
<i>All</i> of the collision in Torque is done against closed convex collision 
meshes (the Terrain is a special case).<br>
<br>
There are some serious optimizations that can be made to collision and ray 
casting code if you assume that the meshes you are colliding against are closed 
convex volumes. Doing collision against arbitrary meshes is becoming more and 
more feasible as processor speeds increase (and with multiple processors and 
physics specific processors) but it is still much, much slower than doing 
collision against convex hulls.<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/tse.jpg'><br>
<br>
Because Torque uses <i>only</i> convex collision meshes, it is very important that you, as
an artist, have a very clear understanding of what it means for a shape to be convex
or concave.<br>
<br>
<b>The Definitions</b><br>
<br>
According to <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Webster</a> the <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/concave">
   definition</a> for concave is:<br>
<br>
<b>con·cave</b><br>
<b>1 :</b> hollowed or rounded inward like the inside of a bowl<br>
<b>2 :</b> arched in <b>:</b> curving in -- used of the side of a curve or 
surface on which neighboring normals to the curve or surface converge and on 
which lies the chord joining two neighboring points of the curve or surface<br>
<br>
It also <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/convex">defines</a> convex as:<br>
<br>
<b>con·vex</b><br>
<b>1 a :</b> curved or rounded like the exterior of a sphere or circle <b>b</b> <b>
   :</b> being a continuous function or part of a continuous function with the 
property that a line joining any two points on its graph lies on or above the 
graph<BR>
<b>2 a</b> <i>of a set of points</i> <b>:</b> containing all points in a line 
joining any two constituent points <b>b</b> <I>of a geometric figure</I> <b>:</b>
comprising a convex set when combined with its interior &lt;a <I>convex</I> polygon&gt;<br>
<br>
If you are scratching your head and going, <i>"Huh?"</i> at this point don't 
worry. That is a pretty common reaction! Let's dive a little deeper into with a 
few handy visual aids and see if we can't clear things up.<br>
<br>
<b>Concave and Convex in 2D</b><br>
<br>
Generally the easiest way to approach concave and convex shapes is to look at 
them in 2D. If you take a look at the diagram below you will see an example of 
a concave shape and a convex shape:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/concavevsconvex2d.jpg'><br>
<br>
You may note that I specifically looking at <i>closed</i> shapes. Why is that? 
Well, the idea of concavity and convexity requires that you have an "outside" 
vs an "inside" or a "front" vs a "back" to the lines, edges, or polygons that 
you are looking at. While we could use the line or face normals to determine 
which side is the front and which side is the back, this can get confusing so 
we are going to stick to closed shapes which have a clear "inside" and 
"outside". This also becomes useful later when we get into a deeper discussion 
of the requirements of the Torque collision system.<br>
<br>
<b>"Inward Curve or Dent"</b><br>
<br>
What is the difference between the concave shape and the convex shape in the 
image above?<br>
<br>
You'll note that the concave shape has this "dent" here:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/dent.jpg'><br>
<br>
This is where the lines making up the shape <i>curve inward</i>. The convex 
shape has no lines that curve inward like this. Instead, all of its lines curve 
outward. As soon as <i>any</i> of the lines form an inward curve like this, the 
shape is considered to be concave. This means that there are a lot of ways to 
create a concave shape:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/variousconcave.jpg'><br>
<br>
There are relatively fewer ways to create a convex shape:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/variousconvex.jpg'><br>
<br>
What are some other ways we can compare a concave shape to a convex shape?<br>
<br>
<b>"The Line Test"</b><br>
<br>
One thing you may note about a convex shape is that, no matter where you draw a 
line that passes through the shape, it will always pass through <i>only two</i> 
of the lines or polygons making up the shape:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/convexlinetest.jpg'><br>
<br>
If you try the same thing with a concave shape it can pass through <i>more than 
   two</i> of the lines:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/concavelinetest.jpg'><br>
<br>
Even if there are places on a concave shape that you can draw a line through 
and have it only pass through two of the lines or polygons, if it can be draw <i>anywhere</i>
on the shape so that it passes through more than two lines, then the shape is 
considered concave.<br>
<br>
This is a fairly straight-forward test that you can "eyeball" as an artist and 
it translates well into 3D shapes so it can be quite handy.<br>
<br>
<b>"The Angle Test"</b><br>
<br>
Another way to look at concave shape is that it has lines or segments that form 
an angle between them that is less than 180°. If you take a look at our 
original concave shape you can see that the lines that make up the dent form 
about a 78° angle:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/concaveangle.jpg'><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, our convex shape is made up entirely of 225° angles:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/convexangle.jpg'><br>
<br>
As soon as <i>any</i> of the angles becomes less than 180° then you are dealing 
with a concave shape. This is a good mathematical test that is easy to code against.<br>
<br>
<b>Convex and Concave in 3D</b><br>
<br>
Hopefully, by this point, you are starting to get a decent idea of what makes a 
2D shape concave vs convex. So how do we translate this over into 3D? It is 
fairly simple:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/concavevsconvex3d.jpg'><br>
<br>
You can run the same tests against the 3D shapes to see if they are 
concave or convex:<br>
<br>
<i>Inward Curve</i><br>
<br>
<img src='convex/dent3d.jpg'><br>
<br>
<i>Line Test</i><br>
<br>
<img src='convex/line3d.jpg'><br>
<br>
<i>Angle Test</i><br>
<br>
<img src='convex/angle3d.jpg'><br>
<br>
<b>Concave and Convex Applied to Torque Collision</b><br>
<br>
Now that you should have a decent handle on what a convex mesh is, let's take
a look at how you apply this to Torque collision meshes.<br>
<br>
In Torque there are two major types of polygonal mesh models: DTS (ThreeSpace
Shapes or just Shapes) and DIF (Interiors).<br>
<br>
Both of these require convex collision meshes but they are created in very 
different ways.<br>
<br>
<b>DTS Shapes</b><br>
<br>
DTS Shapes are models that are created in your traditional 3D modelling 
packages like 3DS Max, Maya, Milkshape, Lightwave, GameSpace, and Blender. The 
meshes themselves have no requirements on how they are built. They can be open 
or closed. They can have volume or be totally flat. They can also be concave. 
These models are very useful for objects in the world that require fine detail 
like a Player model, a weapon, a powerup, or an ornate light fixture.<br>
<br>
Even though the meshes of the DTS Shapes are not required to be convex, their 
collision meshes <i>are</i> required to be convex. This means that the 
visible/rendered mesh rarely matches the collidable mesh. This is fine for most 
things. After all, your player really won't notice that they aren't colliding 
with the rivets on the side of the bucket and if they do it will most likely 
annoy them that it is slowing them down.<br>
<br>
A great deal of game development is creating approximations that are believable 
enough for the consumer to buy into. Even though your collision meshes are 
limited to being convex it is possible to fool the player with a collision mesh 
that works well enough.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the buggy that comes with Torque for an example:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/buggy.jpg'><br>
<br>
As you can see there are quite a few protrusions and detail on this mesh, like 
the fins on the back. For a standard racing game you will never need to collide 
with a mesh nearly so detailed. In fact, if the buggy were to roll over all of 
that detail would get in the way.<br>
<br>
Instead it is simple enough to create a convex hull that approximates the shape 
of the buggy:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/buggyconvex.jpg'><br>
<br>
This convex hull is close enough to the shape of the buggy that the average 
game player is not going to be able to tell <i>and</i> it is simple enough that 
very speedy collision tests can be done against it.<br>
<br>
However, sometimes you are going to need collision meshes that match a lot more 
closely to the visible mesh. For example, take a look at this mesh:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/platform.jpg'><br>
<br>
If we were to approximate the shape of this mesh with a convex collision hull 
it would end up looking something like this:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/platformsingle.jpg'><br>
<br>
This is obvioulsy a problem. If the player were to attempt to walk onto this 
model they would end up walking right up an invisible ramp which would look 
extremely unnatural.<br>
<br>
At this point a lot of artists get the bright idea of just cloning the original 
mesh and using that as the collision mesh. This seems like a good idea except 
that then your collision mesh isn't <i>convex</i>!<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/platformconcave.jpg'><br>
<br>
This is a <i>very</i> common first time mistake among Torque artists. It is 
even further complicated by the fact that the Player can even walk on this 
collision mesh without too much difficultly. <i>But</i> if you were to shoot a 
Projectile at this mesh it would go right through!<br>
<br>
<i><b>Important Note:</b> If you ever have a Projectile go through your collision 
   mesh even when the Player can walk on it, then your collision mesh is <b>not</b>
   convex. It may be a tiny little flaw in the mesh but it is definitely there.</i><br>
<br>
So how do we create a collision mesh that matches up to our visible mesh <i>and</i>
is convex? The secret is to use multiple collision meshes!<br>
<br>
If you combine enough convex meshes together you can create a concave shape.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at a simple arch:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/arch.jpg'><br>
<br>
An arch is a very concave shape and would be impossible to accurately 
approximate with a single convex collision mesh. Instead we can use several 
convex collision meshes and get a much closer approximation of the shape of the 
arch:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/archcollision.jpg'><br>
<br>
The more convex collision meshes we add, the closer it matches our visible 
mesh. Keep in mind, though, that the more collision meshes you add*, the more 
collision calculations have to be done and the slower the collision gets. With 
experience a game artist learns how much it costs them and learns how to tune 
their collision meshes to meet the needs of their game. It is always a balance 
between accuracy and speed.<br>
<br>
Remember our scene above? Here is how you would lay it out so that the 
collision meshes match up with the visible mesh (each color denotes a different 
collision mesh):<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/platformcollision.jpg'><br>
<br>
<i>* Torque did not support more than 9 collision meshes until TGE 1.4.0. Because 
   of this some DTS exporters will not export more than 9 collision meshes.</i><br>
<br>
<b>DIF Interiors</b><br>
<br>
Generating collision meshes by hand for smaller meshes like a car, a player, or 
a platform like the one above can be a little tedious but it isn't too bad. But 
what happens when you start having to generate the collision meshes by hand for 
large buildings or structures or for your entire level? This is where DIF 
Interiors come into play.<br>
<br>
Interiors are made up entirely from convex hulls or, as they are more commonly 
known as by game artists, <i>brushes</i>. So what you see is what you collide against. 
There is <i>no</i> difference between the visible meshes and the collision 
meshes.<br>
<br>
This is accomplished by limiting the artists and their tools to building their 
meshes purely out of convex brushes. They <i>can not</i> create concave or flat 
meshes. Instead they must piece their geometry together out of smaller convex 
hulls. This sounds terribly limiting. How are they supposed to build anything 
that looks good without it having concave curves? As you may recall from our 
earlier discussion, if you combine enough convex pieces together you can get 
concave geometry as a result:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/combo2.jpg'><br>
<br>
One way to think about it is like you are building your structures out of 
somewhat flexible lego blocks. Not all that long ago, every game that required 
high speed collisions was built entirely in this manner. This is beginning to change
but many of the great games of the past were built in this manner:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/bspgames.jpg'><br>
<br>
Fortunately, there are several tools that are designed to make building 
geometry in this fashion easier. While it <i>is</i> possible to build 
brush-based geometry in a traditional modelling package the artists are still 
limited to working with convex brushes which can be hard to do. Also, there are 
not many exporting tools that do a good job at getting mesh data from a 
modelling package out into a form that is usable for brush-based buildings or 
levels. In general, it is actually going to be easier for an artist to learn 
one of the brush-based editors that exist rather than having to relearn how 
they use their current tools. The fact that brush-based editors work only with 
convex hulls means that they are simpler and can be quickly picked up and 
learned. However, it does require a different mindset.<br>
<br>
Torque Constructor is one of these brush-based editors. It was designed to be 
comfortable for traditional 3D artists who are more comfotable working in 
high-end modelling packages. Its highly customizable workflow and interface 
help to ensure that artists will be able to create a working environment that 
is efficient and streamlilned for them. Constructor also leverages the power of 
TorqueScript so that artists can work together with their programming partners 
to extend the existing tools and functionality and to create new tools and 
plugins. Since Constructor is built on top of the powerful Torque Game Engine 
it is completely cross-platform and is a true WYSIWYG Interior editor.<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/constructor.jpg'><br>
<br>
<b>Other Differences Between DTS and DIF</b><br>
<br>
There are few other key differences between DTS Shapes and DIF Interiors. The 
first is that DIF Interiors do not yet support any animation. They also do not 
support transparent textures. If you need animation or transparency then you 
are forced to use DTS models.<br>
<br>
On the other side, DTS Shapes can not include any visibility information. It is 
possible to split a DIF Interior up into a set of zones that only render when 
they are in view of the camera. This optimization can keep most of a building 
from rendering when you only have a small portion of it in view or if you are 
standing in one small part of it. With large DTS Shapes, either all of it is 
rendered or none of it.<br>
<br>
Because a DIF Interior is built entirely of convex hulls or brushes, it is 
possible to run it through a geometry optimization pass when you export them. 
This pass will automatically remove all of the hidden surfaces in the Interior. 
For example, if you have a column that touches the floor the polygon on the 
bottom of the column will never be visible and to render it would be a waste of 
resources. The convex nature of brush-based geometry allows the exporter to 
detect this situation and to remove that polygon without any artist 
intervention.<br>
<br>
DIF Interiors also support lightmap rendering. When a DIF Interior is exported 
the lighting for the structure is precalculated and baked into a set of 
textures that are blended with the diffuse textures of the geometry. Because 
this is done in a non-realtime process, the lighting for this can be <i>far</i> 
nicer than that of the realtime lighting on the DTS Shapes in the game. DIF 
Interiors also support casting precalculated shadows onto the Terrain.<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/terrainshadow.jpg'><br>
<br>
Both DTS Shapes and DIF Interiors <i>do</i> support multiple LOD meshes.<br>
<br>
You can combine DIF Interiors and DTS Shapes together in the Torque Mission 
Editor. This allows you to place a building or structure in the mission and 
then to populate it with higher detail DTS models. You might place a DIF house 
and then put a DTS table and chairs in it:<br>
<br>
<img src='convex/chairs.jpg'><br>
<br>
This also has the advantage that if a DIF Interior zone is not getting rendered 
then the DTS Shapes that are inside it will also not get rendered. It makes 
sense to think of DIF Interiors as the larger buildings, structures, or levels 
that your player will have to run around on or inside of while thinking of DTS 
Shapes are the smaller more intricate models that you use to add fine detail to 
your mission.<br>
<br>
<b>Any Questions?</b><br>
<br>
Hopefully this tutorial has given you a pretty good idea of what the 
difference between concave and convex is as well as a good grasp of the 
differences between a DTS Shape and a DIF Interior. Becoming proficient in 
using this knowledge will take time and practice but it is my hope that this 
tutorial wil lhave given you a solid foundation to work from!<br>
