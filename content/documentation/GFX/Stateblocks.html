                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink1"></a>Concept</h2>
                <p>A new concept introduced to TGEA by GFX2 is Stateblocks. The purpose
                  of GFXStateblocks is quite simple: an entire rendering state is
                  contained in one object, and you are able to set the rendering state
                  with one call. If you've written rendering code before, you may have
                  written code similar to this before: </p>
                <pre>GFX-&gt;setBlendEnable(true);
GFX-&gt;setBlendDest(GFXInvSrcAlpha);
GFX-&gt;setBlendSrc(GFXSrcAlpha);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  What if you need to setup that kind of rendering state more than
                  just once? GFXStateblocks allow you to wrap that up into the following: </p>
                <pre>GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(myState);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  There's a little more tech and setup involved, but the above
                  example should be enough to encourage you to read on and use this new
                  concept in your own project. </p>
                <a name="Technical_Description" id="Technical_Description"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink2"></a>Technical Description</h2>
                <p>Using GFXStateblocks allows you to pre-generate your rendering
                  states, which is going to save you time, clean up your code, apply
                  modern rendering techniques, and give you more control over your game's
                  rendering from the engine <b>as well as script</b>. When combined with CustomMaterials, the material definitions in script need less custom engine support. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Stateblocks are created by filling out a GFXStateBlockDesc structure
                  and calling GFX-&gt;createStateBlock on it. This returns a
                  GFXStateBlockRef, which is a reference-counted GFXStateBlock. This is
                  essentially a GFXResource, just like a texture. Then you use a state
                  block by calling GFX-&gt;setStateBlock and passing the state block in. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Stateblock creation should be done during initialization of
                  your object, as the process is somewhat expensive. Each renderable
                  object has a setupStateBlocks() function, which is then called during
                  an objet's ::onAdd() class method. It is recommended you follow
                  suit with this practice. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Previous versions of GFX and other Torque rendering systems
                  worked under the concept of a canonical render state. Using a
                  stateblock fully defines a render state, which completely does away
                  with all concepts canonical. This is actually a good thing as this will
                  reduce bugs introduced because a state was not properly cleaned up
                  before exiting. </p>
                <a name="Source_Code" id="Source_Code"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink3"></a>Source Code</h2>
                <p>It might help if we tour the engine code, so you can get some concrete code samples in front of your eyes. Start by opening <b>gfxStateBlock.h</b> and <b>gfxStateBlock.cpp</b>, both of which are found in <i>engine/source/GFX</i>. Let's browse the header (.h) first. All four major declarations are important here: </p>
                <pre>struct GFXSamplerStateDesc {...};

struct GFXStateBlockDesc {...};

class GFXStateBlock {...};

typedef StrongRefPtr&lt;GFXStateBlock&gt; GFXStateBlockRef;
</pre>
                <a name="GFXSamplerStateDesc" id="GFXSamplerStateDesc"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink4"></a>GFXSamplerStateDesc</h2>
                <p>The <b>GFXSamplerStateDesc</b> struct contains variables and methods
                  to identify the texture object used for each texture lookup. You'll
                  find texture arguments for color, alpha, min/mag/mip filter, and
                  address modes. A solid example of how this structure is used can be
                  found in the GFXGLStateBlock::activate(...) function. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Inside this method, a GFXSamplerStateDesc variable (ssd) is
                  set to one of the stateblocks internal samplers. The function performs
                  a check to see how OpenGL handles the GL_TEXTURE_2D variable: </p>
                <p><br />
                  Abbreviated code from GFXGLStateBlock::activate(...), found in engine/source/gfx/gl/gfxGLStateBlock.cpp </p>
                <pre>const GFXSamplerStateDesc ssd = mDesc.samplers[i];

switch (ssd.textureColorOp)
{
case GFXTOPDisable :
   if(!tex)
      break;
   glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
   updateTexParam = false;
   break;
}
</pre>
                <a name="GFXStateBlockDesc" id="GFXStateBlockDesc"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink5"></a>GFXStateBlockDesc</h2>
                <p><b>GFXStateBlockDesc</b> defines a render state, which is then used
                  to create a GFXStateBlock instance. If you look through the structure,
                  you will read through some common render state ops and references:
                  blending (source/destination/operation), depth buffer (z buffer
                  enable/bias/deinition), color writes (write red/blue/green/alpha), and
                  so on. </p>
                <p><br />
                  A nifty concept applied through GFXStateBlockDescr is the
                  combining state block descriptions. This is done so through
                  the ::addDesc(...) function: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>/// Adds data from desc to this description, uses *defined
                  parameters in desc to figure out what blocks of state to actually copy
                  from desc.</b> </p>
                <pre>   void addDesc(const GFXStateBlockDesc&amp; desc);
</pre>
                <a name="GFXStateBlock" id="GFXStateBlock"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink6"></a>GFXStateBlock</h2>
                <p>The base GFXStateBlock class looks very bare. It is derived from
                  StrongRefBase and GFXResource. Being a StrongRefBase object, the
                  stateblock will exist as long as the reference exists. When all of the
                  strong references to the stateblock go away, it is permanently deleted.
                  It is treated as a GFXResource since our GFX system needs to track its
                  resources owned by a particular device. </p>
                <p><br />
                  There are only 4 functions in this base class, and they are
                  all virtual. This is due to the fact that we have multiple graphical
                  APIs to support, which means we are going to have GFXStateBlocks for
                  DirectX and OpenGL: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>GFXD3D8StateBlock </li>
                  <li>GFXD3D9StateBlock </li>
                  <li>GFXGLStateBlock </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br />
                  Of course, we have our null device stateblock
                  (GFXNullStateBlock), but you will not actually need to use that for any
                  rendering. The other GFX devices will have their own implementation of
                  stateblocks. In fact, let's take a look at the GL implementation. Open <i>engine/source/gfx/gl/gfxGLStateBlock.h</i>. The class we are looking at is <b>GFXGLStateBlock</b>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Within this function we have a working interface (constructor and
                  destructor), a function called by OpenGL to activate the stateblock
                  (::activate), and a tangible GFXStateBlockDesc member variable (mDesc).
                  The activate function definition can be found in <b>gfxGLStateBlock.cpp</b> </p>
                <pre>GFXGLStateBlock::activate(const GFXGLStateBlock* oldState)
{
   // Internal code not shown
}
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  It is heavily commented and has a very important warning at the
                  beginning. It is highly recommended you read through the comments and
                  code to get a better understanding of how the stateblock is set up. </p>
                <a name="GFXStateBlockData" id="GFXStateBlockData"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink7"></a>GFXStateBlockData</h2>
                <p>Two very important classes we need to take a look at is the GFXStateBlockData class, found in <i>engine/source/gfx/sim/gfxStateBlockData.h/.cpp</i>.  The class definitions and their comments are quite descriptive: </p>
                <pre>/// Allows definition of render state via script, basically wraps a GFXStateBlockDesc
class GFXStateBlockData : public SimObject

/// Allows definition of sampler state via script, basically wraps a GFXSamplerStateDesc
class GFXSamplerStateData : public SimObject
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  As you read, these classes allow us to create GFXStateBlock and
                  GFXSamplerState descriptions in TorqueScript. This means you are able
                  to a lot more custom shader and rendering work without being as reliant
                  on custom engine code. You should definitely look through
                  the ::initPersistFields() functions for each class. You will
                  notice the various references and ops that make up a render state are
                  exposed. </p>
                <a name="Engine_Example" id="Engine_Example"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink8"></a>Engine Example</h2>
                <p>We are going to use a very simple engine example for showing how GFXStateBlocks are created and used. Start by opening <i>engine/source/interior/interior.h/.cpp</i>.
                  When we use debug rendering, we are able to see certain aspects of an
                  interior that are normally invisible to a player. One such aspect would
                  be the rendering of portals. </p>
                <p><br />
                  In the Interior class, we have defined multiple stateblock references. Let's look at one that affects our portal rendering: </p>
                <pre>GFXStateBlockRef mInteriorDebugPortalSB;
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Ok! We have our stateblock reference, but it still needs some
                  information. Go into Interior.cpp, and scroll down to the
                  prepForRendering function around line 428: </p>
                <pre>bool Interior::prepForRendering(const char* path)
{
     // Previous and remaining code not shown

     mInteriorDebugPortalSB = GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(sh);

}
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  This line of code shows we have initialized our stateblock
                  reference, but wait a minute...what device does so? We haven't seen any
                  OpenGL or DirectX code anywhere, so how can we know if we are using a
                  GFXGLStateBlock or not? This is where GFX2 takes control. <b>GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(...)</b> takes in a fully initialized GFXStateBlockDesc reference. </p>
                <p><br />
                  GFX then proceeds to set up the hash value and search for existing
                  stateblocks. If the stateblock we need does not exist, it calls <b>createStateBlockInternal</b>.
                  This function drills into our platform's device, so we have a
                  GFXGLDevice::createStateBlockInternal, a
                  GFXD3D8Device::createStateBlockInternal, and a
                  GFXD3D9Device::createStateBlockInternal. </p>
                <p><br />
                  When creating a GFXStateBlock in script, quite a few things
                  happen for you automatically. However, when you are in the engine there
                  are a few "Gotchas" you have to remember. <b>When you create a GFXStateBlock in the engine, you must call setStateBlock before you use it!</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Called in Interior::debugRenderPortals():</b> </p>
                <pre>GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(mInteriorDebugPortalSB);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  A simple, more generic engine example would be this: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Instead of:</b> </p>
                <pre>  GFX-&gt;setBlendEnable(true);
  GFX-&gt;setBlendDest(GFXInvSrcAlpha);
  GFX-&gt;setBlendSrc(GFXSrcAlpha);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Use this:</b> </p>
                <pre>  // Setup code, done once
  GFXStateBlockDesc desc;
  desc.setBlend(true, GFXSrcAlpha, GFXInvSrcAlpha);
  GFXStateBlockRef myState = GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(desc);

  // Render time code
  GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(myState);

</pre>
                <a name="Script_Example" id="Script_Example"></a>
                <h2><a name = "HeaderLink9"></a>Script Example</h2>
                <p>Earlier, I mentioned using CustomMaterials and GFXStateBlocks
                  together in script. We have provided you with a couple of examples.
                  Open gameExamples/T3D/game/scriptsAndAssets/data/terrains/materials.cs.
                  This file contains quite a few stateblocks and custom materials. Let's
                  focus on one: </p>
                <pre>new GFXStateBlockData(TerrainLightingState)
{   
   blendDefined = true;
   blendEnable = true;
   blendSrc = GFXBlendOne;
   blendDest = GFXBlendOne;
 
   samplersDefined = true;
   samplerStates[0] = SamplerWrapLinear;
   samplerStates[1] = SamplerBlendTextureAlpha;   
   samplerStates[2] = SamplerClampLinear;   
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  The above code demonstrates how to declare a GFXStateBlock in Torque Script using the exposed Console Object, <b>GFXStateBlocKData</b>. In this example, we set a render state to enable bledning with a source being BlendOne, and our destination being BlendOne. </p>
                <p><br />
                  We also define our samplers as WrapLinear,
                  BlendTextureAlpha, and ClampLinear. We can then use this stateblock in
                  one of our CustomMaterial definitions: </p>
                <pre>new CustomMaterial(TerrainMaterialDynamicLightingMask)
{
   texture[1] = "$blackfog";
   texture[2] = "$dynamiclight";
   texture[3] = "$dynamiclightmask";
   
   shader = TerrDynamicLightingMaskShader;
   version = 1.1;
   preload = true;
   stateBlock = TerrainLightingState;
   fallback = TerrainMaterialDynamicLightingFF;
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Not only that, but we can use the same GFXStateBlock for other CustomMaterials: </p>
                <pre>new CustomMaterial(TerrainMaterialDynamicLighting)
{
   texture[1] = "$blackfog";
   texture[2] = "$dynamiclight";

   shader = TerrDynamicLightingShader;
   version = 1.1;
   preload = true;
   stateBlock = TerrainLightingState;
   fallback = TerrainMaterialDynamicLightingFF;
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Essentially, we wanted the exact same rendering state for our
                  two custom materials. Instead of having to modify our engine code
                  (twice), we can define our stateblock in script (once) and use it
                  multiple times. </p>

                <p>There is a lot to learn about GFXStateBlocks. The intent of this doc
                  was to give you a strong introduction on the purpose, engine structure,
                  and examples of how to use this new system. As you develop new shaders
                  and CustomMaterials, look for ways you can save yourself time and
                  headaches by using GFXStateBlocks. </p></td>
